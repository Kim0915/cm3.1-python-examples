## Institutional Goals
Many younger students struggle with learning the concepts of programming, due to the lack of practice during non-lesson hours. Many times, instructors' idea of "simple homework" is often much too complex for the students as well. Thus, these exercises are meant to act as the bridge to fill in the time between lessons. These questions are **extremely** easy with a slow ramping difficulty. Ideally, students will learn and ingrain concepts by mass repetition. 

## Student Goals
These examples should be able to completed **alone** by the student. First, answers should be written on a printed version of a problem sheet. Then, students can check their answer by typing in the code on Replit. This is the two-step process that students will do in repetition between coding classes at Coding Minds.

## Development
The "Example-Sheet" provides an example of what one of our worksheets may look like. If you are interested in helping the development of this project, you can take a look at the "ProblemCreationGuide" on this repository. Contact Moohyun Kim on Basecamp for more details.

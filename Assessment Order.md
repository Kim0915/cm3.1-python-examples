# Python Assessment Ordering

## Purpose
The purpose of the assessments is to make sure that students are learning the concepts behind the exercises. The assessments will be slightly higher in difficulty and length. Students will be graded based on completion/percentage correct, and will continue practicing the topic until they are able to meet the testing requirements.
